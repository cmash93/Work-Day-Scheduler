# Work Day Scheduler
* A daily work scheduler to keep track of appointments and due dates during standard business hours!

## What I did:  
* I used Moment.js to get the current time. 
* Each time block will be color coded to reflect whether or not the scheduled event is in the past, present, or future.
* Gray: past; red: present; green: future.
* Each scheduled event is saved in local storage and can be accessed even after the page is loaded.
